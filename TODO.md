## On Deck

* dialogue trees as JSON data
* dialogue engine

## To Do

* Character sprites
* Clock/timer
* Reference map
* houses?
* clutter (flowers, pavers)
* NPC sprite randomizer

## Probably

* map that updates as you explore
* roaming knights to waste your time

## Probably Not

* day/night cycle
* dungeons to escape from after you're captured

## Wishlist

* a Jack-Frost-but-not-Jack-Frost character that makes his way across the map towards the crossroads. When he arrives, winter is here, and the game ends... better hope you have the lords on board before then!
* a "living" village with a cast of randomly generated characters to talk to 

## Done!

* Decent maze generator
* Reasonably accurate general purpose wang-tile renderer
* smooth transitions between nodes
* tilemap depth rendering (treetops)
* controls refactor/cleanup

## Bugs

* null currenttile when colliding with south world boundary
