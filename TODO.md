## On Deck

* tilemap depth rendering (treetops)

## To Do

* Character sprites
* Dialogue system
* Clock/timer
* Reference map

## Wishlist

* day/night cycle
* map that updates as you explore
* a Jack-Frost-but-not-Jack-Frost character that makes his way across the map towards the crossroads. When he arrives, winter is here, and the game ends... better hope you have the lords on board before then!
* a "living" village with a cast of randomly generated characters to talk to 
* roaming knights to capture you and waste your time
* dungeons to escape from after you're captured

## Done!

* Decent maze generator
* Reasonably accurate general purpose wang-tile renderer
* smooth transitions between nodes
