#### The Witch and The Wedding
Hello wanderer, you're lucky you found this village before the grues got you, the forest around here is swarming with them. Don't tell anyone, but I'm a witch, and the only reason these idiots survive every winter is because I do some magic on a wedding before frost arrived.

But there's a problem... Winter is at the edge of town and as soon as he arrives at the crossroads here - it's all over for these dorks. They'll starve.

Here's what I need - right now the Prince Paris is set to marry Juliet Capulet. But royalty isn't magic! They're the opposite! She needs to marry body from the dirt. Like that nice Montague boy, Romeo. Set them up, and get the prince out of the picture. Then we'll have a wedding before winter arrives, and nobody dies. Sound good? All right, off you go.

* Escalus sets up the feud between Capulets and Montagues
* Escalus demands Paris Marry Juliet Capulet
* Romeo and Juliet already in love, want to marry
* Paris and Juliet not in love, but will do as Capulet and Escalus demand
* Capulet and Montague feud because _____

#### The Witch and The Enchantment for Mild Winter

Winter is coming - you will meet him on the road to my home. If he arrives before I have what I need to enchant the village he will curse us with a hard winter that will likely kill us all. I'm getting feeble, and I can't collect the ingredients myself, and I can't ask the townsfolk either, or they would know I'm a witch and hang me.

I need:
* A hair from the heads of each of a pair of true lovers
* Shredded unicorn horn
* Spectral mushroom
